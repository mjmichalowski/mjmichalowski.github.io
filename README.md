## Welcome to My Portfolio!

Below, you can find some of my work in Python and Matlab, as well as articles and reports I have written.

### Matlab Projects

There are three of my Matlab projects you can view on this website. They are all described by a report which explains the aim, application and outcome (code provided within):

1. _Recurring Digits Finder_ - this project is based on number theory, specfically the decimal expansions of fractions. It aimed to quickly and efficiently find their repeating digits and the period length. [Click here](matlab/project_1/Recurring_Digits_Report.pdf)
2. _Fox and Rabbit Problem_ - this project uses Matlab to solve a system of coupled PDEs. The scenario describes a rabbit running towards its burrow and a fox which is trying to catch the rabbit before it reaches safety, while avoiding obstacles on the way. The motion of the fox is deeply connected with the position of the rabbit and the barrier at any given point. The application of Matlab here can be widely used for many real-world dynamic scenarios.

3. _Big Data Analysis_ - this project employs some of the techniques useful in analysing big data sets. It uses a large, imaginary set containing information (date, price, variety etc.) about natural products in order to present some key facts which could be used to make business decisions in this scenario. Naturally, these techniques are highyl applicable in both scientific and business analysis. [Click here](matlab/project_3/Project_3_Report.pdf)

### Python Projects

1. _Finding the Width and Mass of a Z-Boson_ - this script analyses data sets of decays across differing energies. It assumes the process can be described as a first order Feynman diagram of an electron-positron pair annihilating into a Z-Boson, which then decays into a new particle-antiparticle pair. Notably, it uses _tkinter_ package to display a GUI from which the user can explore different options and perform the analysis. The program is quite versatile in that it allows the user to:```
  - change the decay products
  - provide external data sets using finder
  - display multiple plots
  - save the data and plots to a desired location.```
Object-oriented programming is employed to simplify the construction of the main loop of the GUI. [Click here] (python/z_boson_gui.py)
